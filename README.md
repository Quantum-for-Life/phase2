# phase2

[![CI](https://github.com/Quantum-for-Life/phase2/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Quantum-for-Life/phase2/actions/workflows/CI.yml)

Quantum phase estimation (QPE) with parallel computing. üè≠

# Dependencies

To run the simulations, you will need:

- Linux platform, with a C/C++ compiler toolchain
- CMake>=3.9
- [HDF5][hdf5-website]
- optional: [OpenMPI][openmpi-website]

To prepare input for the simulation and to run the test suite, we require:

- Python >= 3.10 and a virtual environment with several packages installed
  locally (see [README.md](./python/README.md) in the `python/` subsystem for
  more details.
- Rust [nightly toolchain][rust-nightly] (see [README.md](./rust/README.md) in
  `rust/` for more info).

Assuming we're on Ubuntu, to install the dependencies, run:

```bash
sudo apt install gcc g++ cmake 
sudo apt install libhdf5-dev hdf5-tools

sudo apt install python3 python3-dev python3-venv

curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ${HOME}/.cargo/env
rustup toolchain install nightly
rustup default nightly
```

and optionally:

```bash
sudo apt install libopenmpi-dev openmpi-common
```

If you want to run the simulation on Euler cluster (ETHZ), you only need to load
necessary modules:

```bash
env2lmod
module load gcc
module load cmake
module load openmpi
```

## Getting the sources

Make sure you've got read access
to [https://github.com/Quantum-for-Life](https://github.com/Quantum-for-Life)
and you can clone repositories via HTTPS. The easiest way to do it is to
first install [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/):

```bash
type -p curl >/dev/null || (sudo apt update && sudo apt install curl -y)
curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo dd of=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
&& sudo chmod go+r /usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg \
&& echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null \
&& sudo apt update \
&& sudo apt install gh -y
```

Then authenticate Git:

```bash
gh auth login
```

Now you can clone the repo and its dependencies:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Quantum-for-Life/phase2.git
```

If you prefer to access GitHub via SSH instead, be aware the repositories
this package depends on as submodules have their URLs hard-coded as HTTPS.
And some of them are still private to _Quantum-for-Life_.  You will need to 
change the remote repo URL for each submodule to its SSH equivalent.

# Compiling the source code

```bash
cd phase2
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

If you want to enable MPI support, run CMake with `DISTRIBUTED` flag set:

```bash
cmake -DDISTRIBUTED=ON ..
make
```

# Testing

Run the test suite by typing:

```bash
cargo test
```

All contributions are welcome. üîë

Writing documentation and tests is especially important. Below you can find a
brief overview of how to submit your patches to the project. If, instead, you
would like to simply report an issue, feel free to open one
[here](https://github.com/Quantum-for-Life/phase2/issues).

You can start off with forking this repository on GitHub and getting a local
clone:

```bash
git clone https://github.com:[username]/phase2.git
```

where `[username]` is your GitHub account holding the fork.üç¥

Check out the main branch and create a topic branch for your work:

```bash
git checkout -b my-topic main
```

It is important that you start `my-topic` from the tip of the current `main`
branch and not from, e.g., another topic branch or `next` (see below).

When your code is ready for review, open a pull request (PR) to merge your
branch into this repository's `main`. A PR on GitHub is the place where your
changes can be discussed in detail, and your work improved and expanded.

In the meantime, you branch will be merged into `next` to see if it plays nicely
with other changes currently to be implemented. You will be able to see if your
code passes our
[test suite](https://github.com/Quantum-for-Life/phase2/actions)
running continuously on GitHub Actions.

Once the changes are accepted, your branch will be merged into `main`. Here's a
few tips how to make this process as smooth as possible:

1.  Do not merge `next` into your topic branch. The `next` staging tree may have
    got all the newest hot-rod stuff, but utimately it's a throw-away: it can be
    reset anytime if it gets too messy. (For more info, see e.g.
    [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitworkflows); we don't need
    `seen` or `pu` trees here, as our project isn't big enough).
2.  If you need other topic branches for you work, merge them in with `--no-ff`
    git option.
3.  Do not rebase branches that others have access to. Except for your topic
    branch: you can squash, rebase, twist and contort all you want, even during
    the PR.
4.  We will ask you to write unit tests for all the changes you'd like to
    introduce.
5.  Trying to keep git history linear and tidy √† la
    [Gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) isn't
    necessary, though: complex nonlinear commit logs can be easily parsed with
    `git log --first-parent`.
